# FractalTree

Status: Ongoing

Summary: Trees are natural fractals, patterns that repeat smaller and smaller copies of themselves. In this project I generate a fractal tree utilizing precision to automate the tree branches growing off of each other. On top of the classic fractal tree I implemented flowers on the ends of the trees to give it some personality.
